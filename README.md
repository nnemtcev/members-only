# About
Members Only is a side project that I built while following the self-taught NodeJS curriculum on The Odin Project. It was built using NodeJS, Express, HTML5, and includes pre-made styles from Materialize.

# Features
- Username/password based authentication from scratch using PassportJS.
- Sign up and sign out functionality also implemented from scratch.
- Create posts using a form.
- 'Upgrade' your account to a 'member' by entering a secret password.

# To-do
- 'Upgrade' your account to an 'admin' account by entering another secret password.
- Improve styling, make the web app responsive.
